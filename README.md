### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

My name is Shreyash Gupta, and I am a passionate Computer Science professional with a Master's degree in Engineering from Cornell Tech. As the Co-founder and CTO of Cloud Code AI, I lead the technical development at our company. Our main goal is to create an AI abstraction for cloud and DevOps, which will allow developers to focus on building high-quality applications instead of dealing with the complexities of cloud resource management.

I have a diverse background in computer science, with a strong foundation as a software engineer. I've worked on various projects, from machine learning to automation, and have gained valuable experience along the way. Before Cloud Code AI, I also co-founded a web-based 3D EdTech platform, which further solidified my roots in the technology landscape.

I'm always excited to engage with fellow developers and technology enthusiasts!
